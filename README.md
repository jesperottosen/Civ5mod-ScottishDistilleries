# Civ5mod Scottish Distilleries

50 cities with distillery names, Unique Whisky Distillery and Unique Unit Scotch Highlander.

Building from the many Scotland Mods that came before me: JFD's The Kingdom of Scotland, MC's Scotland. Though there can be only one Scotland.

The Whisky Distillery Unique Building is based on MOD: Winery and Distillery Additions v5. Plain distilleries added for all civilizations.
City must have fresh water nearby, no ressource requirements.
The Whisky Distillery adds a small increase to a city's Gold and promotes Science and Happiness.

The Civilization comes with a Scottish unique Highlander (rifleman).
All melee units receive "Defender of Scotland" promotion for 50% combat boost against fortified units.
All gun powder units receive "Last of the Free" promotion for Combat bonus in hills (attack and defense).
All Scotch Highlander units receive "Ignore terrain cost" promotion.
